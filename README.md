# Brain Ageing - Multivariate Statistics on MRI images
Application of multivariate statistics on brain hMRI images (Master's thesis in BioEngineering) to study the effect of ageing.

## Goal
* Apply statistical analyses to study how microstructures are affected by ageing. 
* Compare univariate and multivariate statistical approaches.
* Analyze and evaluate the pertinence of a normalization technique (VBQ) used to pre-process the data.
* Create a batch interface to allow the researchers to apply permutation tests in a simple and user-friendly way.

## Technologies
Project created with:
* Matlab
* SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping): https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/
* PALM (Permutation Analysis of Linear Models): https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/PALM

## Method
* Statistical analyses on the images: parametric (one-tailed and two-tailed t-tests), nonparametric (permutation tests).
* Comparison of both approaches: Dice coefficients, true positive rate, false positive rate, percentage of significant voxels.
